<p>When I first heard about SoftLayer, the first thing that popped into my head was “just another web hosting company”. Boy was I wrong! Little did I know I would be diving head first into a world that would open my mind and push me to challenge myself on the very first day.</p>
<p>I’ve only been with SoftLayer for three weeks, but in this short period of time I’ve been exposed to more innovative strategies, open-ended techniques and an overall strive to better ourselves than I’ve seen in a lifetime. It’s obvious that innovation is more than just a philosophy but key to our success.<br />
Having been given this opportunity, I’m extremely excited to integrate myself into a company with so many aspirations and a genuine desire to redefine the very way we develop our communities.</p>
<p>I have been a developer for nearly twelve years now, starting with self-taught HTML and eventually expanding to PHP (MySQL) and JavaScript (AJAX/jQuery) over time. I consider myself a specialist in the open-source platform <a href="http://blog.softlayer.com/tag/drupal">Drupal</a> and have found it can perform wonders; in most instances, is a developer’s dream platform.  I will be focusing on the continued growth of our Drupal platforms at SoftLayer.</p>
<p>Though I love developing, I’m more than just a computer nerd.  Creativity seems to go hand-in-hand with our industry and like many of the people I encounter in the communities I help develop, I’m not an exception.  After all, you can’t create without first having an idea.  I enjoy creative writing and hope to one day make a full-blown hobby out of it – if I can ever pull myself away from the computer!</p>
<p>I’m not only excited to see how I can help SoftLayer grow, but to see how I, as an individual, will be transformed in the process with SoftLayer’s  “open idea” strategy of supporting different ideologies  and working with the amazing people here.</p>
