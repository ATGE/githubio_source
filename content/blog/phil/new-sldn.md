<p>Good news everyone!</p>
<p>The past few months we have been working feverously on redesigning the SoftLayer Development Network site.</p>
<p>The goals for this first release are as follows:<br />
* Maintain level of functionality and features of the previous SLDN<br />
* Unify browsing experience by collapsing the blog and reference documentation into a single content management system<br />
* Lay the groundwork for advanced features such as rating, comments, user generated content, and even a real time feed of API changes</p>
<p>Please give us your feedback.  This site is for you, and your ideas matter!</p>
<p>Until next time:<br />
