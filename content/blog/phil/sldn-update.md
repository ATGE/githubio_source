<p>The SoftLayer Developer Network thrives on your feedback!  Let us know what features and improvements you would like to see in the future.  You can reach the SLDN team at <a href="mailto:sldn@softlayer.com">sldn@softlayer.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Change Log:</strong><br />
*A number of GUI tweaks which should make the site a bit more kind on the eyes.<br />
*The blog section has been removed and now all blogs and news articles will appear on the home page.<br />
*A tag cloud has been added to provide filtering for blog/news articles.<br />
*Inline code examples on method pages will show when a relevant example exists(check <a href="/reference/services/SoftLayer_Ticket/edit">SoftLayer_Ticket::edit</a> for an example of the examples)<br />
*Single Sign On with your SoftLayer portal account: You can now log into SLDN with the same account information you use for manage.softlayer.com.<br />
*Question/Answers section:  This feature was created to provide a more direct way to get information.  This is in the initial phases so the ability to search/filter/find what your looking for will grow with time.  The idea at its core is simple however, ask a question, and other users(including SoftLayer employees!) will have the ability to answer.<br />
*Improved search: We taught the search indexer more about each page making results more relevant.  You can also now filter the results by type of content(article, method, services, etc...)</p>
<p>Keep your seat-belts fastened and your hands off the remote because more is on the way!</p>
