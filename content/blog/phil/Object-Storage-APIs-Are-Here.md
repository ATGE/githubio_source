<p>SoftLayer Object Storage is based on OpenStack Swift and provides integrated indexing, searching and CDN support.   Information stored to SoftLayer Object Storage is written multiple times to self-healing clusters which have the ability to immediately restore data in case of drive failure.<br />
Unlike previously released APIs SoftLayer Object Storage is only available on a REST interface.  However, very much like our other APIs will you have the ability to fully interact with SoftLayer Object Storage programmatically. </p>
