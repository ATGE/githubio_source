<p>(This post refers to SoftLayer API version 1. Check out <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/03/2008/and-now-for-something-completely-different/">API version 3</a> for our latest updates.)</p>
<p>We've put a Java SOAP example up on our <a href="/downloads">downloads</a> page. This was written in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> 3.2.2, and for your convenience the example package contains our Eclipse project files. The code should run on JVM version 1.4 and above. We'd love to hear your feedback on this example. Reply here or post on our <a href="http://forums.softlayer.com/forumdisplay.php?f=27">forums</a> and let us know what you think. See ya'll later!</p>
