<p>Howdy everyone! We've been pounding some really cool features out lately and just updated our documentation wiki with their API services. In addition to a whole <i>ton</i> of new additions to the <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Account">SoftLayer_Account</a>, <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Hardware_Server">SoftLayer_Hardware_Server</a>, and our other staple services we're proud to introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Account">SoftLayer_Network_ContentDelivery_Account</a></b> - Control hosting on our content delivery network.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account">SoftLayer_Network_Media_Transcode_Account</a></b> - Configure and use SoftLayer's free (as in beer!) media transcoding service.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Network_LoadBalancer_Global_Account">SoftLayer_Network_LoadBalancer_Global_Account</a></b> - This'll help you out if you run large and geographically diverse websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love the wide collection of services we've got running here. Quite a few of the features available in our CDNLayer API is from direct user feedback. If you have any questions how to use these services or want us to implement a feature drop us a line on our <a href="http://forums.softlayer.com">forums</a>. In the meantime happy coding, everyone!</p>
