<p>After a three hour flight that took five hours from LA to Dallas I'm finally home from the <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">Southern California Linux Expo</a>. This was SCaLE's 8th show, an evolution that started as a meeting of Linux User Groups from the Los Angeles area that grew into one of the largest Linux, open technology, and community focused events in the region.</p>
<p>This is my second year attending SCaLE. I went last year as a part of an open source project I was working with and had a pretty good time. I jumped at the chance to go again when I found SoftLayer had a booth at and was sponsoring SCaLE 8x.</p>
<p>I'm really glad I went; I dig these community-focused events. What strikes me about these events, and SCaLE in particular, was the general optimism of the staff, attendees, speakers, and exhibitors. This show is on a weekend, and people came because they genuinely care about FOSS, cool new (and sometimes old) tech, and community advocacy. Most attendees fit the classic nerd stereotype. We got to meet our fair share of skinny pale guys, scruffy and ponytailed sysadmin types, and bearded folks with wallet chains and Star Trek t-shirts. </p>
<p>When not working our booth I was able to duck out and attend some of the talks at the expo. Aside from being informative (I picked up a lot about technical writing that I can't wait to throw into our API documentation), every single talk I attended was completely packed to the point where there was standing room only. It's refreshing to see speakers talk about things other than the company they work for. Instead, they focused on cool tech or how to be more productive in your community or with a specific technology. I took pages and pages of notes this weekend, it felt like being in school again.</p>
<p>I think SoftLayer did well at SCaLE 8x. We got our name out like we usually do at these events, and got to introduce a new group of people to SoftLayer and our ever-changing and sometimes hidden industry. I hope we're sponsoring SCaLE 9x. Even if we don't you'll still find me there. See you next year!</p>
