<p>We've opened up the backend API that powers our <a href="http://www.softlayer.com/cloudlayer_storage.html">CloudLayer Storage</a> systems for y'all. Those of you who want more control over your cloud storage accounts and content should definitely check this out.</p>
<p>We've got instructions conveniently hosted on our cloud systems:</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.cloudlayer.com/v1/public/A8C742DC-757A-11DE-B0D6-EBF676FC7253/7C9CC9CF16BA73EEA686D190BF49C29F8C3709CF">CloudLayer&trade; Storage API v.1 Documentation</a> (1.3MB)</p>
<p>This is a bit of a departure from our standard API. It only covers manipulation of CloudLayer Storage accounts, and is accessed via REST-full URLs. Head dev honcho Nathan gave us a rundown of <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/07/2009/79/">how to access it in curl</a> a while back. It's incredibly powerful and gives you complete control over what you host and share on the cloud. Give it a try and let us know what you think!</p>
