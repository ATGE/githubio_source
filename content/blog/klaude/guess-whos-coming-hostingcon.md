<p>Every year I get the same question from my customers, "Hey Klaude, are we going to see you at <a href="http://www.hostingcon.com/">HostingCon</a> this year?". Every year I respond with the same thing, "I have no idea. I'll ask!". Every year I hear from my management, "Not this year, Kevin." after I ask if I can go. Representing SoftLayer at the big trade shows is a coveted job amongst the SoftLayer enlisted, especially for an event like HostingCon.</p>
<p>This year I was asked the same thing I'm asked every year, but this time it was suggested that I could probably tag along with the cool kids if I gave a talk or ran a session. That's a pretty good idea. I pitched it to my boss, and to my surprise he agreed. That's great! Now all I have to do is schedule a presentation, and I'm set! A month or so full of research and agonizing over minutia has led to a talk I'll be giving with Ilya Baimetov from <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> about providing services with APIs. Our slot is at 3:00PM on Wednesday, August 12th. Stop on by if you're in the Washington DC area, want to see a giant collection of businesses in the hosting industry, and want to visit the guys who run your favorite dedicated and cloud hosting company. When not speaking you'll find me at the SoftLayer booth giving API demos and free hugs. </p>
<p>SoftLayer is well represented in the <s>HostingCon event schedule</s>. Our CFO, Mike Jones, is headlining Monday's keynote "Surviving the Financial Crisis", and CTO Nathan Day is participating in Tuesday's general discussion "Offering Cloud Services to Your Customers". The event runs form Monday, August 10 to Wednesday, August 12 at the <a href="http://www.gaylordhotels.com/gaylord-national/">Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center</a> in National Harbor, Maryland. We'd love to meet you. Drop on by and say hi!</p>
