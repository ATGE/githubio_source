<p>(This post refers to SoftLayer API version 1. Check out <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/03/2008/and-now-for-something-completely-different/">API version 3</a> for our latest updates.)</p>
<p>Howdy, everyone. The SoftLayer dev team has been growing a bit lately to handle new portal additions and adding fancy new methods to the API for ya'll. So far we've gotten some great feedback on the API and how to make our application servers work better for you and your businesses. Now that we've got the API out and some extra head count what say we kick into high gear?</p>
<p>Here's our game plan. We know how smart our customers are. We know how they think (we hope). They're geeks who find perverse joy in taking things apart, reassembling them, and building cool new toys out of the leftover parts. We want you to give that a try with our API. Our <a href="http://forums.softlayer.com/forumdisplay.php?f=29">Implementations Forum</a> has a good start, but we're looking for something to really knock our socks off. So far the coolest thing we've seen is a <a href="http://forums.softlayer.com/showthread.php?t=1503">Yahoo! widget</a>. Who can top that?</p>
<p>Email us, post to the forum, or leave a comment here with sweet implementation goodness. Surprise us. Show us what wacky stuff you can do with your server and our API. If you don't code then that's fine. Send us your ideas. Maybe someone will pick up on it. To get the ball rolling we'll write an app or two of our own. Even better we'll release the source of our app to get ya'll started. Let's see what kind of cool programs we can write.</p>
