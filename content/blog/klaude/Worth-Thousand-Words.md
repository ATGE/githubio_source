<p>Logan, the chief architect behind our API framework, has been playing with <a href="http;//graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> lately to make pretty pictures out of our codebase and help find areas for improvement. You'd be surprised at how much a map of your object relationships can help make your structure more efficient. These pictures looked so cool that I asked him for a diagram of our API's object relationships. </p>
<p>The picture below represents how each API data type relates to each other. The ones with the most lines connecting them to outher types are <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Account_%28type%29">SoftLayer_Account</a> and <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/SoftLayer_Hardware_%28type%29">SoftLayer_Hardware</a>. Go figure. : ) Click on the image below for a higher resolution version for your viewing pleasure. It looks most impressive when printed out and taped to your cubicle wall. Enjoy! See y'all next time. </p>
