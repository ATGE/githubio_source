<p>I've been working with quite a few PHP users on our <a href="http://forums.softlayer.com/">forums</a> over the past few months. One thing I love is the sheer variety of tasks you guys are accomplishing. One thing I don't really love is how y'all use the sample code we provided when we launched our new API last year. Our examples work great for API v1 to API v3 migrations, but those simple functions don't really do our current API justice. </p>
<p>To that end I've written a new PHP API client. This small library will let you take real advantage of the features our API has to offer (like <a href="/article/object masks">object masks</a>, <a href="/article/Using-Result-Limits-SoftLayer-API ">result limits</a>, proper exception catching, and the like) in both SOAP and XML-RPC. Please <a href="http://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-api-php-client/tree/master">download it</a> from our new presence on the <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> social code hosting site. Come check us out at:</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/softlayer/"><b>http://github.com/softlayer/</b></a></p>
<p>Right now all that's up there is our PHP API client. We'll put more client libraries and projects up as we make them. We've got a a few in the works right now. If you've already got a github account come find us! We love to meet those who want to use and modify our work. If you have a favorite language that you want to see a client library for please let us know and we'll see what we can do. The next language on my hit list is Python 2.6. See y'all next time!</p>
