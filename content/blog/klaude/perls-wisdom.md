<p>It's been a little over a week since our API launch. I haven't heard from anyone who doesn't like it, so that must mean we're doing it right. We've been spending time lately catching up on little quirks and documentation bugs. Our <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/Implementing_SOAP_in_Perl">first example</a> is up. Its for you Perl jockeys, and really exemplifies the flexibility and power of <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/Using_Object_Masks_in_the_SoftLayer_API">object masks</a> in your API handling code. We've got a .NET one coming up soon. You guys are going to love how easy it is to use this in Visual Studio. We've got plans for PHP and Java coming up too. If there's a language or implementation you want to see please let us know!</p>
<p> In other news, SoftLayer has recently launched a shiny new <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6934851257">Facebook group</a>. Sign in and join up to talk with us and get your hands-on exclusive content (which currently is videos of me rambling about the API). As always, we're here if you have questions, concerns, or just want to chat. See you next time!</p>
