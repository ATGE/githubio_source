<p>If you haven't done so yet, please migrate your apps and scripts based on version 1 of the SoftLayer API to <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/The_SoftLayer_API">version 3</a>. Version 3 is chock full of tools and methods that touch every single facet of your servers, your account, and our business. If you've been following threads on <a href="http://forums.softlayer.com/">our forums</a> since last March then you're likely using our latest API and don't need to migrate anything. We've sent notices to those of you who have recently used API version 1. Check out the <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/Migrating_API_v1_applications_to_v3">migration page</a> on our wiki for some tips on how to update from version 1 to version 3. </p>
<p>We plan to turn the old API off on August 1, 2009. Please post to our forums if you need help migrating or open a support ticket if you'd like to work one-on-one. Thanks, everyone!</p>
