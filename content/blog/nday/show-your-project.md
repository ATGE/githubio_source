<p>Everyone at SoftLayer is excited about the API. But we can't wait to see what our customers are going to be doing with it. You can go to the implementations page to see some examples of ways to use the API. What we would really like to put on that page is a list of applications developed by our customers. If you create a use for the API that is new and unique, or if you just want to show the world how cool you are - send us an email at <a href="mailto:sldn@softlayer.com">sldn@softlayer.com</a> and tell us about it and we will feature your project on the implementation page.</p>
