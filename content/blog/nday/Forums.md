<p>We have launched a new group of forums to provide an area where developers and SoftLayer customers can discuss topics related to the SoftLayer API and receive new features / release announcements for the API. Additionally, you can showcase your newly developed applications that utilize the SoftLayer API.</p>
<p>Section one “Announcements” provide information pertaining to new additions of downloadable content, official add-ons for server control panels and other related software, new features that have been added to the API, and any upgrade windows pertaining to SoftLayer API infrastructure. </p>
<p>Section two “Implementations”  is intended to discuss projects you have integrated into the API and projects you would like to see designed and built using the API.  From Control Panel integrations to desktop application development, show us what you have got or would like to see. </p>
<p>Section three “General API Discussion” is for all API users.  Have a question or issue with your application or the API?  This is the forum for all things API.</p>
<p>Whether you need assistance or would like to help other users get up and running, the new API forums is a great place to start your project utilizing the SoftLayer API.</p>
