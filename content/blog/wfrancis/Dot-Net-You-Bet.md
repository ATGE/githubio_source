<p>Greetings fellow SLAPI enthusiasts!  When the call went out for examples I figured why not cowboy up and try my hand at with a .NET example.  After all, being an MCP in a largely PHP shop makes me as qualified as anyone.  Plus I am constantly pushing the Microsoft Kool-Aid around the office so this was a chance to put my money where my mouth is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was just one catch—I’m not a .NET programmer.  I’ve got 10 years of experience writing drivers, protocol suites, and firmware.  In other words,   C/C++ with a little bit of assembler thrown in when push comes to shove.  Sure I can write a c-sharp application, but I’m pretty green at it and until a month ago if someone had told me they had a problem with their WSDL (pronounced wiz’duhl) I would have wondered why they were telling me instead of their urologist!</p>
<p>That said, what follows is a pretty basic SLAPI example, done in both C# and VB.NET (because I’m ambi-dot-dextrous).   Don’t expect anything more than a DOS-style command console for the UI.  I’m used to letting the Microsoft’s control panel give the user any feedback and usually consider my code to be ready to ship if it can run for 24 hours without blue-screening the box!</p>
<p>My chops are on display at the <a href="http://sldn.softlayer.com/wiki/index.php/Implementing_SOAP_in_.NET">SLDN API Wiki</a>. Let me know what you think!</p>
