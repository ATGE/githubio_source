#### API
- Update [SoftLayer_Account::getNetworkStorage()](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/getNetworkStorage/) API call for replicationStatus, should no longer throw Exceptions on certain volumes.
- Fix for [SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::setTags()](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest/setTags/) when tags are empty. Effectively calling setTags with an empty tag will clear tags on the VM.
- Update storage and image information tables with backingFileWdek and ImageWdek fields to support custom encrypted images.
- Prevent SUSPENDED->IAMID_INVALID transition for [SoftLayer_User_Customer::editObject()](/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer/editObject/)
- [SoftLayer_User_Customer_Notification_Hardware::createObject](/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer_Notification_Hardware/createObject/) will return the created object.
- Improve documentation for [SoftLayer_User_Customer_Notification_Virtual_Guest](/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer_Notification_Virtual_Guest/).
- Add start and end date, and server ID parameters to the new [SoftLayer_Account::getBandwidthList()](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/getBandwidthList/) API.
- Adds a limit to queries for SoftLayer_Metric_Tracking data.
    + Exception: SoftLayer_Exception_ApiRequestFailed
    + Message: API request failed. Expected result size too large, please update the query
- [SoftLayer_Account_Historical_Report](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account_Historical_Report/) methods [getAccountUrlUptimeSummary](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account_Historical_Report/getAccountUrlUptimeSummary), [getAccountHostUptimeSummary](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account_Historical_Report/getAccountHostUptimeSummary), [getAccountUrlUptimeGraphData](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account_Historical_Report/getAccountUrlUptimeGraphData), [getAccountHostUptimeGraphData](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account_Historical_Report/getAccountHostUptimeGraphData) have had a nullable accountId parameter added due to PHP7's strictness, but it is unused. No behavioral change to callers providing the previous parameters. This nullable accountId parameter is required in manually built requests as an <accountId xsi:nil="true"/> element.**

#### Backend 
- Clarify the error message when placing quotes without a country.
