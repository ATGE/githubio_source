#### API
- Implement disabledSnapshot for Block and File volume replicas
    + [SoftLayer_Network_Storage::disableSnapshots](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage/disableSnapshots/)
- Prevent detach of local disks for VSIs greater than 300GB
    + Exception:
    ```xml
    <faultcode>SoftLayer_Exception_Public</faultcode>
<faultstring>Disk capacity exceeds the maximum size eligible for portability on local storage and can not be detached.</faultstring>
<faultactor></faultactor>
    ```
- Fixed an issue causing fixed configurations to not handle disk controller limits properly.
    + When verifying or placing an order, fixed configuration presets will populate the `storageGroups` property on server order containers with those defined by their preset, rather than remaining empty. Verifying an order now does not fail if the `storageGroups` property is set when a fixed configuration preset is also provided. Any storage groups will be ignored in favor of the preset's.
    + The order response will now contain the fixed config preset's storage groups on verifyOrder and placeOrder responses.
    

#### Backend
- Remove advanced monitoring/nimsoft as a requirement for managed services servers
