#### Portal
+ Added a customerWaitTime field on the ticket search page in the customer portal. The customerWaitTime is the time the customer has been waiting for a response on a ticket. Multiple updates by the customer have no effect on this field and a reply by an employee resets the timer to zero.
+ Pushed fix that tests that only numbers, letters, and spaces are allowed for all of the titles for contacts when trying to order an SSL certificate. The Symantec API does not accept any special characters in the 'title' field for contact information and this was causing orders to fail. 

#### API
+ None

#### Backend
+ Resolved a bug preventing OS reloads from having partitions if reloading from a Customer Supplied OS (NO OS System).
