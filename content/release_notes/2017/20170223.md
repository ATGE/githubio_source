#### Portal
+ Portal Exception message was unclear when a user without 'ticket add' and 'ticket view' permissions tried to create an upgrade order. New change accurately indicates that the user must have these two permissions in order to create an upgrade order.

#### API
+ None

#### Backend
+ Fixed two separate bugs in Endurance and Performance Storage provisioning where provisions were stalling due to API call timeout.
