#### Portal
+ None

#### API
+ Deprecated the `blueIdAuthenticationRequiredFlag` method and replaced it with the [ibmIdAuthenticationRequiredFlag](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/ibmIdAuthenticationRequiredFlag) method for the [SoftLayer_Account](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account) service.  
+ Added `isoCodeAlphaThree` to the returned data for the [SoftLayer_Locale_Country::getCountries](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Locale_Country/getCountries) and [SoftLayer_Locale_Country::getAvailableCountries](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Locale_Country/getAvailableCountries) methods. This returns the 3 character ISO code for a country. 

#### Backend
+ Added logic for Brazil and India to support local currency for billing.
