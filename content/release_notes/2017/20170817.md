#### Portal
+ Fixed an issue on the order form where Dedicated Host Instance orders were not showing all size options available in some Datacenters.

#### API
+ Corrected a bug where using [SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::createObject](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/softlayer_virtual_guest/createobject) to order a dedicated host instance with SAN disks would error out with `Unable to find a price for block device 0`. 

#### Backend
+ Pushed code to handle active/active clustering for the Cloud Load Balancing offering.
