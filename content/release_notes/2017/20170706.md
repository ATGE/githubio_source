#### Portal
+ Resolved an issue where applying security groups may cause errors during the provision of a Virtual Guest. 

#### API
+ Pushed code to resolve an issue with the `resultLimit` for [SoftLayer_Ticket_Subject::getAllObjects](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Ticket_Subject/getAllObjects) method. Before the fix the API was returning less data than the limit set. 
+ Addressed an issue with the PHP Library for the [SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_IpAddress_Global::route](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_IpAddress_Global/route) method. If the endpoint IP address provided is associated with an unrouted subnet a fatal error was being returned.
+ Fix a bug when ordering bare metal servers where presets that do not include GPUs are failing to be ordered from.

#### Backend
+ None
