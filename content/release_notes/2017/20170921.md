#### Portal
+ Resolved an issue where a subset of DCs where not displaying the 1,2,4 or 8 core options for Dedicated Host Virtual Guests. 
+ Pushed code that that corrected a display issue when ordering Dedicated Host Virtual Guests. When selecting Local drive Virtual Guests do not show the 3rd, 4th, and 5th disk options. 

#### API
+ Added validation to prevent monthly LBaaS orders via the API since the [SoftLayer_Network_LBaaS_LoadBalancer](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_LBaaS_LoadBalancer) service is only available with hourly billing. 

#### Backend
+ None
