#### Portal
+ Released code to support Volume Duplication. This offering adds the ability to order a new volume, pre-loaded with the contents of a File or Block Volume or Volume Replica, or a snapshot of a Volume or Volume Replica.
+ Changed the default option for monitoring from Basic to None, for VSI order forms.
+ Added the ability to assign [Security Groups](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup) to an interface on the Virtual Guest order form for customers that are enrolled in the Beta. 


#### API
+ Added the `getUsageChargeFlag` method to the [SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice_Item](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice_Item) service. This method will determine if a Billing Invoice Item is from a service that has usage limitations. 
+ Added the [getCountriesWithListOfEligibleCurrencies](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Currency_Country/getCountriesWithListOfEligibleCurrencies) method to the [SoftLayer_Billing_Currency_Country](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Currency_Country/getCountriesWithListOfEligibleCurrencies) service. 
+ Added API permissions check for the `REMOTE_MANAGEMENT` permission on the [SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest). The permissions check affects the following methods: pause, powerOn, powerOff, and resume.
+ Updated the [SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Hub_Cleversafe_Account::getEndpoints](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Hub_Cleversafe_Account/getEndpoints) method to return the both the Cross Regional and Regional Cloud Object Storage S3 endpoints. 
+ Exposed the [SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup) service to SLDN. The Security Group product is currently in Beta so the APIs will not work unless your account has been granted access.  
+ Exposed the Volume Duplication offering to the `slcli` python command line client. This offering allows you to order a new performance/endurance volume from an existing volume. 

#### Backend
+ None
