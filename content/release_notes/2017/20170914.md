#### Portal
+ Fixed an issue where standard disk prices were being incorrectly hidden for some datacenters during the order process.
+ Virtual Guest Family sizes are now live on the order form. You can read more about the Family sizes [here](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/09/public-virtual-server-families/). 
+ Added new functionality to the order forms to support multiple disk controllers for bare metal offerings. 
+ Added the following new offerings in the Bluemix catalog: [Container Registry](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/containers-kubernetes/home/registryGettingStarted?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south), [Informix On Cloud](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/informix-on-cloud?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=containers), [Master Data Management on Cloud](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/master-data-management-on-cloud?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=containers), [Information Server on Cloud](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/information-server-on-cloud?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=containers), [JanusGraph](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-janusgraph?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=containers), [Monitoring](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/monitoring?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=containers), and [Log Analysis](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/log-analysis?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=containers). 

#### API
+ Fixed a bug where the results from [SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::generateOrderTemplate](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/softlayer_virtual_guest/generateordertemplate) were not showing the new Family Size Virtual Guests.   
+ Introduced a new feature which enables customers to specify a backend router for bare metal server orders via API. 
+ The [SoftLayer Python CLI](http://softlayer-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) was updated for Family Sizes and Dedicated hosts. The virtual create-options command was updated to show flavors and the dedicated host options. The virtual create command was updated to accept a flavor key and a host id. 
+ Added the method [getSupportedDataCenters](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup/getSupportedDataCenters) to service [SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup). The new API will return a list of [SoftLayer_Location_Datacenter](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Location_Datacenter) objects, which represent the datacenters where security groups are available.


#### Backend
+ Corrected a bug that was causing customers to be unable to boot Virtual Guests in to our rescue environment.
