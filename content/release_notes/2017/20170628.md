#### Portal
+ Added the ability to order the Mass Data Migration Service. This offering can only be ordered by the master account user. It allows for the secure migration of up to 120TB of data per device into / out of Cleversafe Object Storage using physical storage appliances housed in waterproof, tamper-evident, shockproof cases. [Official Documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/mass-data-migration/index.html#ibm-bluemix-mass-data-migration).

#### API
+ Resolved an issue that was allowing customers to order duplicate volumes without specifying a datacenter location using `placeOrder`.
+ Fixed an issue where calls to `getAllObjects` on the [SoftLayer_Location_Group_Pricing](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Location_Group_Pricing) service were failing.
+ Corrected a bug that was allowing the deletion of a [Dedicated Host](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_DedicatedHost) via the API even when there were active VSIs still deployed to the Dedicated Host. 
+ Published the [Dedicated Host](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_DedicatedHost) services and methods page to the [SLDN](http://sldn.softlayer.com).

#### Backend
+ None
