#### Portal
+ When a server is reloaded customers now have the option to enable LVM on the storage groups during the reload.
+ Added support for performance pricing when you duplicate storage volumes. Rolled out the ability for a user to create a new volume from an existing volume or snapshot. When creating the new volume a user will have the ability to either keep the configuration of the new volume (size, IOPS tier, etc) or make changes to the configuration. 

#### API
+ None

#### Backend
+ Added additional disk controller categories to make it possible for there to be more than one disk controller ordered in a server.
