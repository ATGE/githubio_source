#### Portal
+ None

#### API
+ Added the [getLocalCurrencyExchangeRate](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice/getLocalCurrencyExchangeRate) method to the [SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Invoice/) service. This allows users to retrieve the exchange rate used for billing an invoice.
+ Users can now call [SoftLayer_Network_Storage::createOrUpdateLunId](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage/createOrUpdateLunId) to change the LUN ID on a block volume. For example, if a user is trying to access multiple volumes from a single initiator, then it is possible that some volumes will have the same LUN ID which may cause conflicts on the initiator. The createOrUpdateLunId method allows the user to resolve any conflicts by assigning different LUN IDs to each volume.

#### Backend
+ None
