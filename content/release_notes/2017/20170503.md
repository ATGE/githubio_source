#### Portal
+ Resolved a bug that was causing duplicate pricing information to be shown for storage options on the portal order form.

#### API
+ Fixed [SoftLayer_Network_Storage::storageTierLevel](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage/getStorageTierLevel) to always return a string value instead of a [SoftLayer_Billing_Item](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Item) object.

#### Backend
+ Fixed a bug that would automatically allow inactive image templates to be used for VSI OS Reloads.
