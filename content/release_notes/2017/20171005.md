#### Portal
+ [IBM Bluemix Load Balancers](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/09/ibm-cloud-bluemix-load-balancer/) are now live in the customer portal. 
+ Performance and Endurance Block volumes can no longer have their LUN Id changed unless all host authorizations are first removed. This is to ensure synchronization between the customer portal and the storage systems.

#### API
+ None

#### Backend
+ Added more logic when auto-scaling Virtual Guests. The new logic checks the dates in the logs first and makes sure there are no other provisions or reclaims within the cooldown period of time.
+ Fixed an issue where Virtual Guests being deployed from Image templates were set to Skip OS updates during provisioning.
