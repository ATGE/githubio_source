#### API
- [SoftLayer_Network_Tunnel_Module_Context::applyConfigurationsToDevice](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Tunnel_Module_Context/applyConfigurationsToDevice/) will not generate a transaction. Error handling has been updated to use typed errors and altered messaging.

#### Backend
- Volume refresh transactions will no longer stall on a known error, alleviating the need for manual intervention from Customer Support.
- Dependent duplicate will become independent after the completion of the  convert_to_independent process
