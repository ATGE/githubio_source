#### Portal
+ Added an error message when trying to order from a datacenter your account does not have access to.

#### API
+ Fixed an issue that was causing migration failures of local disk VSI's to SAN disk VSI's when a metadata disk was attached.
+ Fixed an issue that was causing the preset.totalMinimumHourlyFee to be rounded to the nearest integer when using Hardware.getCreateObjectOptions on hourly bare metal servers.
+ Users must now have permission to access a Hardware or VSI to be able to request an upgrade.
+ Fixed an issue where large sized metadata/userdata was causing timeouts during the provisioning process.
