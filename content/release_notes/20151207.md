#### Portal
+ Fixed an error that would occasionally prevent the "Reconfigure KVM Console" link from properly reconfiguring the KVM console.

#### API
+ SMTP Inbound traffic from the public internet is now blocked for new accounts by default. This does not effect backend networks.
+ Reverse PTRs for new domain records will be ip4.static.sl-reverse.com and ip6.static.sl-reverse.com
