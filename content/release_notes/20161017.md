#### Portal
+ Updated the page title and icon on the control portal compute order forms to reflect IBM Bluemix.

#### API
+ Resolved an issue with the [getMappedAccounts](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer_OpenIdConnect/getMappedAccounts) method not correctly displaying the  accountLinks section of the output.
+ When any sub-brand is created by a brand master account it now automatically has the brand attribute ALLOW_ACCOUNT_CREATION set to 1.This resolves an issue what required Sales Operations to manually set the ALLOW_ACCOUNT_CREATION to 1 on sub-branded accounts.
+ Allowed the IAM token service to indicate that 2 factor authentication has been fulfilled in the case it has been performed recently. This will be done by including a flag in IAM token to indicate that 2FA is not needed. This is for the [getPortalLoginTokenOpenIdConnect](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer_OpenIdConnect/getPortalLoginTokenOpenIdConnect) method.

#### Backend
+ None
