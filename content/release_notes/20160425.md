#### Portal
+ None

#### API
+ Resolved an issue with the syntax for getSnapshotRanges for the methods [getMemoryMetricImage](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest/getMemoryMetricImage) and [getCpuMetricImage](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest/getCpuMetricImage) that was causing incorrect values to be returned. 
+ Corrected a bug in the Branded Agents Portals in which the count returned by [getImpactedAccountCount](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Notification_Occurrence_Event/getImpactedAccountCount) did not match the result size of [getImpactedAccounts](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Notification_Occurrence_Event/getImpactedAccounts)

#### Backend
+ Resolved an issue that was causing host migrations to fail if a Virtual Guest was powered off.
