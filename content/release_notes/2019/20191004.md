#### API
- Block NextGen images from being ordered on classic VSIs. Image templates have "features" that track which platform the image is capable of provisioning, Classic, Generation Classic (GC), and NextGen.  Classic VSI's can only be provisioned with image templates identified by the Classic feature. 
- SoftLayer_User_Customer::selfPasswordChange will return a new session token after success.

#### Backend
- WebCc components of evault provisions alongside servers will now function as intended. Customers will no longer need to re-order evaults and ask backup ops for assistance.
- Assures that an order cannot contain more NVMe SSDs than what is supported by the associated hardware chassis.
- Assures that NVMe SSDs are indexed last among the disk prices.
