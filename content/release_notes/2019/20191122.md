#### API
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions to be thrown if NVMe disks were not added to the end of an order's price list. 

#### Backend
- Introduces ability for customers to add or upgrade their network gateway licensing. The new upgrade path has no impact without the new software license products being available in the product catalog. This issue also improves the customer experience when attempting to perform hardware upgrades for a gateway which is not allowed.
