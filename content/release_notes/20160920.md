#### Portal
+ None

#### API
+ Added the [getOpenIdConnectMigrationState](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer/getOpenIdConnectMigrationState) to the [SoftLayer_User_Customer](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer) service. This new method allows users to query whether an open invitation exists for a user.

+ Fixed an issue with NO OS servers that was causing the Evault Bare Metal restore transaction to fail.
