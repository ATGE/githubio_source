#### Portal
+ Fixed a bug to enforce correct cancellation order of volumes with replicas. Previously it was possible to cancel storage with replica, but the process would fail as the replica must be cancelled first. The portal will now direct to you first cancel the replica volume. 

#### API
+ Updated the [SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest) service's [getCreateObjectOptions](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest/getCreateObjectOptions) method to not show options that are no longer available, such as old operating systems that are no longer supported.
+ Added massReloadOperatingSystem and massFirmwareUpdate to the [SoftLayer_Hardware_Server](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_Server) Service. 
+ Fixed the error message returned when calling [SoftLayer_User_Customer_Notification_Virtual_Guest::createObject ](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer_Notification_Virtual_Guest/createObject) with an invalid User. 
+ Deprecated the [requiredCoreCount](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Item_Price/getRequiredCoreCount) from being included by default on [SoftLayer_Product_Item_Price](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Item_Price) objects to improve API performance. If you have API requests that use `requiredCoreCount` implicitly, please ensure it is included in object masks or move to using `capacityRestrictionType`, `capacityRestrictionMin`, and `capacityRestrictionMax`.

#### Backend
+ Fixed an issue where ordering IP addresses sometimes failed when using the PayPal payment method or when attempting to order from a quote.
+ Changed SoftLayer to IBM Bluemix in a number of automated emails and tickets.
+ Mass Reboot and Migrate tickets now send out the contents of the ticket updates in emails. Previously they just included links to the ticket in the customer portal.
