#### Portal
+ Fixed an issue where R1Soft Server options were not showing up while initiating an OS Reload.

#### API
+ Added [getVmWareActiveAccountLicenseKeys](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/getVmWareActiveAccountLicenseKeys) to SoftLayer_Account service.


#### Backend
+ Resolved a bug in which hosts authorized to multiple iSCSI Volumes became deauthorized from all iSCSI Volumes when one Volume was explicitly deauthorized. 
+ Resolved an issue that was preventing Local Load Balancers and Netscalers from completing the provisioning process due to an errant RAID card check.
