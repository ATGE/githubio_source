#### Portal
+ Pushed code to allow for the ordering of Network VLAN's from the customer portal.

#### API
+ Created the [initiatePortalPasswordChangeByBrandAgent](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer/initiatePortalPasswordChangeByBrandAgent) method for the [SoftLayer_User_Customer](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer) service. The Brand Agent must have permission to Add Customer Accounts to the Brand in order to initiate the password reset in this way.

#### Backend
+ Resolved a bug that was causing Paypal orders to fail due to a missing property for Hourly Bare Metal servers.
