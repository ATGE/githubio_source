#### Portal
+ None

#### API
+ Resolved an issue where [SoftLayer_Brand::createObject](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Brand/createObject) requests coming in from the API were not creating an associated SoftLayer_Policy_Brand record. This bug resulted in user accounts created under the new brand to be unable to log in to the customer portal.


#### Backend
+ None
