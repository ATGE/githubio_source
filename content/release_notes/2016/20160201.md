#### Portal
+ Resolved an issue that was preventing the portal from properly enabling Private VLAN spanning. 

#### API
+ Exposed [getAllowedHardwareIds](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer/getAllowedHardwareIds) and [getAllowedVirtualGuestIds](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer/getAllowedVirtualGuestIds) to the [SoftLayer_User_Customer](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer) service. This helps with API timeout issues on accounts with a large amount of Bare Metal Servers and or Virtual Guests.
+ Resolved an issue where calling [denySharingAccess](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest_Block_Device_Template_Group/denySharingAccess) would cause an image template to go in to an inconsistent state.


#### Backend
+ Added the ability to specify userdata to [Hourly Bare Metal Servers](http://www.softlayer.com/info/hourly-bare-metal-servers)
+ Enabled the automatic migration of local disk VSIs on disabled hosts on VSI power off or reboot.
