#### Portal
+ Fixed an issue in which a ticket was unable to be updated if there was special text in the ticket update.
+ Resolved an issue where the order forms were not loading properly for non-English languages.

#### API
+ Resolved an issue where the description for [SoftLayer_Metric_Tracking_Object::getObject](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Metric_Tracking_Object/getObject) was not appearing on SLDN or API metadata.
+ Resolved an issue in which creating a Bare Metal server via [SoftLayer_Hardware::createObject](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware/createObject) was setting the RAM value to 0GB.
+ Resolved an issue with [SoftLayer_Search::search](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Search/search) not returning the same results as [SoftLayer_Search::advancedSearch](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Search/advancedSearch).
+ Added [createSnapshot](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage/createSnapshot) method to Endurance storage volumes to enable manual snapshots to be created via API. 

#### Backend
+ Updated code so that ticket updates no longer send duplicate emails if two subscribers/users exist with the same email address.
+ Updated the logic on http://www.softlayer.com/bare-metal-search so that when you choose a Bare Metal server the subsequent page will only show Datacenters in which that configuration is avilable.
