#### Portal
+ Made changes to the order form to align with the change in colored branding to the customer portal. 

#### API
+  Resolved issues of API response timeout when removing a users API key. This occurred on customer accounts with a lot of Object Storage users.  
+ Resolved an issue that was causing changes in products and catalog offerings to not be properly reflected in the [SoftLayer_Product_Package_Server](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Package_Server) service. 
+ Added the [getGlobalIdentifier](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Resource_Metadata/getGlobalIdentifier) method to the [SoftLayer_Resource_Metadata](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Resource_Metadata) service. 

#### Backend
+ Rolled out code to limit the number of combined manual and scheduled snapshots that are supported on Block and File Storage. Going forward the limit is 50 snapshots per volume. The portal and API will now display a warning if there are 50 snapshots on the system for a particular volume, and the user tries to create the 51st snapshot manually. The scheduled snapshots are auto deleted per retention policy when their limit is reached.
