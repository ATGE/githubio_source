#### Portal
+ Resolved an issue with incorrect placements of order sliders during checkout.

#### API
+ API deprecation warning: [SoftLayer_Network_Component::getPortStatistics](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Component/getPortStatistics) will be functionally deprecated on May 2, 2016. After this time the method will return a deprecated exception. Upon the next release version of the API, it will be removed.


#### Backend
+ Fixed a rare bug in Hourly Bare Metal provisions that occurred when a customer had a VLAN on a Monthly Bare Metal server router in the same datacenter as the new Hourly Bare Metal Server. The issue causes a stuck transaction during the provisioning process.
+ Added the functionality to register .us TLD domains.
