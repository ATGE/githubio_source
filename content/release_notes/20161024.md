#### Portal
+ Changed portal layout and color scheme to match the new IBM Bluemix branding.
+ Fixed an issue where SoftLayer tired support customers could create a ticket with severity level higher than 4. 

#### API
+ Added the [getFileBlockEncryptedLocations](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage/getFileBlockEncryptedLocations) method to the [SoftLayer_Network_Storage](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage) service. This method can be used to get a list of SoftLayer_Location objects corresponding to datacenters which support Encryption at Rest for File and Block Storage.

#### Backend
+ When a user's password expired, we are no longer automatically sending the password reset email. Instead, the user will be informed that their password has expired and that they need to use the Reset Password link on the login page to change it.
+ Updated automatically generated customer emails to reflect new branding.
