#### Portal
+ Corrected an issue on the Bluemix order forms where the order form content appear in a different language based on the www.softlayer.com language cookie. The order forms are set to English until all language translations have been completed.
+ Increased the space allowed for addresses when making payments via PayPal. The shorter space was causing PayPal transactions to fail when an account used a bunch of unicode characters.
+ Fixed an issue where users might be immediately logged out after navigating to the order forms due to a non-public API call.

#### API
+ None

#### Backend
+ None
