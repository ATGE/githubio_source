#### Portal
+ None

#### API
+ Resolved a bug when calling the methods [failoverToReplicant](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi/failoverToReplicant), [failbackFromReplicant](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi/failbackFromReplicant), or [immediateFailoverToReplicant](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi/immediateFailoverToReplicant) from the [SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi) class instead of the base [SoftLayer_Network_Storage](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Storage), in which the method would return true, but the process would not be started.


#### Backend
+ Created an internal tool to unlink Bluemix and SoftLayer accounts. Customers can now open a ticket to request their Bluemix and SoftLayer accounts be unlinked.
