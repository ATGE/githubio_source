#### Portal
+ Fixed an issue where some exception errors were not getting their messages properly translated, so the actual error message was being masked.

#### API
+ Resolved an issue that was causing a call to [SoftLayer_Resource_Metadata::getBackendMacAddresses](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Resource_Metadata/getBackendMacAddresses) to return duplicate results.
+ Resolved an issue that was preventing Sales quotes from being callable via the API.

#### Backend
+ Customers with Private Host VSI's can call to opt-out of host reboots for major maintenance events.
