+ Fix an issue where pricing was not properly filtered based on other order form selection
+ Update redirect to control for login to a HTTP code 302

#### API
+ Prevent fatal error when loading active usage prices
+ Fix rule validator for IPv6 addresses when creating firewall rules
+ When a .vhd or .iso file is imported the API should not allow any encryption parameter to be specified. If the user specified encryption fields with a .vhd or .iso the API should return an exception.
+ Update SoftLayer API documentation for SoftLayer_Network_Component, as SoftLayer_Network_Subnet::getNetworkComponent link causes a 404.
+ Fixed an issue with  SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi::createSnapshot not immediately creating a snapshot in some cases.
+ Improved query used in SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup::getSupportedDataCenters

#### Backend
+ When a NetScaler device delete is attempted the delete may fail because the SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest is being referenced in the accounts "applicationDeliveryControllers".  This causes the NetScaler device to remain on the accounts Device List but no actions are available.
