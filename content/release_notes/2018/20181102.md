#### API
- Add SoftLayer_Hardware_Server::isVirtualPrivateCloudNode
- Defaulting simple ordering ( SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::createObject()) to suspend for hourly SAN based VSIs
- Added SoftLayer_Hardware_Server::getBootModeOptions(). The boot mode options are dependent on the firmware installed on the server. It will always return at least ["BIOS"] or ["BIOS", "UEFI"] for web servers. If the server is not a web server (e.g. HSM), return an empty list.


#### Backend

- Fixed an issue where some reserved instance guests were not showing up in SoftLayer_Account::getVirtualGuests()
- Adds a requirement for customers to have the same level of permissions to order a reserved capacity as is currently required to order virtual and hardware servers.
