# Added SLDN Documentation
We have finally retired the old [SLDN](https://sldn.softlayer.com) site, and migrated its content over to [softlayer.github.io](https://softlayer.github.io). 

The following content types have been added, in addition to the existing release notes, and code examples.

* [Articles](https://softlayer.github.io/article/)
* [Blogs](https://softlayer.github.io/blog/)
* [Services](https://softlayer.github.io/tags/service/) and their associated [Methods](https://softlayer.github.io/tags/method/)
* [Datatypes](https://softlayer.github.io/tags/datatype/)

If you notice any issues with the content here, please create an issue on our [github page](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer.github.io/issues)
