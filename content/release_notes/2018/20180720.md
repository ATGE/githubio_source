#### Portal
- Fixed numerical format for a variety of currencies.
- Fix an issue that would've incorrectly determined a promotion as not meeting location requirements for certain configurations.
- Fixes a bug that allowed users to select an irrelevant datacenter when ordering CDN.  The datacenter selection did not break the order, it was just ignored.  This fix clears up possible confusion.

- Added validation for boot mode and supported boot mode attributes when editing image templates.
- Updated HVM guest check to include customer-supplied HVM images with the boot mode set.
- Adding a new API method to allow customers to enable/disable IPMI. SoftLayer_Hardware_Server:: toggleManagementInterface()

#### Backend
- Added new status for MDMS Requests, 'DEVICE_ASSIGNED', and modified functionality for transitioning of a request from device assigned to prepping device.
- Improved boot mode logging for virtual disk import.
- Remove time-between last upgrade/downgrade validation check for File/Block storage
